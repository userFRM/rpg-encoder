[command.prompt]
text = """
Perform autonomous semantic lifting on this codebase using cheap LLM APIs.

First, estimate the cost: `rpg-encoder lift --dry-run`

Show the estimate to the user. If they approve, run the full lift:
`rpg-encoder lift --provider anthropic`

The lift pipeline:
1. Auto-lifts trivial entities (getters, setters, constructors) without LLM calls
2. Sends remaining entities to the LLM in batches for semantic feature extraction
3. Synthesizes file-level features
4. Discovers functional domains and assigns 3-level hierarchy

Progress is saved after each batch. If interrupted, re-running continues from where it stopped.

After completion, run `rpg-encoder info` to show the updated graph statistics.
