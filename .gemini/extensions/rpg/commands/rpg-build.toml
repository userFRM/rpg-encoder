Build a Repository Planning Graph for this codebase using the rpg-encoder CLI.

Run: `rpg-encoder build`

This indexes all source files, detects languages, extracts entities, builds the dependency graph and structural hierarchy. The graph is saved to `.rpg/graph.json`.

If the graph already exists, use `--force` to rebuild. After building, run `rpg-encoder info` to show the result.
