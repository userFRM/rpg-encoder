Search the codebase semantic graph for entities matching the user's query.

Run: `rpg-encoder search "$PROMPT" --mode auto`

Use `--mode features` for intent-based search (e.g., "validate user input", "handle HTTP errors").
Use `--mode snippets` for name/path matching (e.g., "auth", "parse_config").
Use `--scope AREA` to restrict to a functional area.

Show the results and explain what each entity does based on its features and location.
